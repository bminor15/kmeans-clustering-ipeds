## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


## Introduction

In retail, not all customers are the same. Some shop often and spend a lot, while others buy less or shop only occasionally. Treating all customers the same can lead to missed opportunities. K-Means clustering helps retailers by grouping customers with similar behaviors, such as spending levels or shopping frequency. These groups can then be targeted with the right offers, discounts, and services. Beyond customers, K-Means can also be used in inventory management, dividing products into fast-moving, stable, or slow-moving categories to reduce waste and improve stock planning.
