## Introduction

In retail, not all customers are the same. Some shop often and spend a lot, while others buy less or shop only occasionally. Treating all customers the same can lead to missed opportunities. K-Means clustering helps retailers by grouping customers with similar behaviors, such as spending levels or shopping frequency. These groups can then be targeted with the right offers, discounts, and services. Beyond customers, K-Means can also be used in inventory management, dividing products into fast-moving, stable, or slow-moving categories to reduce waste and improve stock planning.

For this project we are working with a retail dataset that holds transactional records with details on purchases and spending patterns. Our plan is to clean and prepare the data, choose features that capture customer and product behavior, and then apply K-Means clustering to see how the groups form. From there we will evaluate the clusters and describe them in clear terms, showing how the results can guide decisions for marketing, promotions, and inventory.
