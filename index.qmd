## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


## Introduction

In retail, not all consumers are alike. Some people shop frequently and spend a lot of money, while others buy little or just sometimes. Treating all consumers equally might lead to lost opportunities. K-Means clustering assists merchants by grouping clients who exhibit similar habits, such as spending levels or purchasing frequency. These categories can then be targeted with relevant promotions, discounts, and services. Beyond consumers, K-Means may be utilized in inventory management to eliminate waste and enhance stock planning by categorizing things as fast-moving, stable, or slow-moving.
