    "text": "Introduction\nIn retail, not all customers are the same. Some shop often and spend a lot, while others buy less or shop only occasionally. Treating all customers the same can lead to missed opportunities. K-Means clustering helps retailers by grouping customers with similar behaviors, such as spending levels or shopping frequency. These groups can then be targeted with the right offers, discounts, and services. Beyond customers, K-Means can also be used in inventory management, dividing products into fast-moving, stable, or slow-moving categories to reduce waste and improve stock planning.\nFor this project we are working with a retail dataset that holds transactional records with details on purchases and spending patterns. Our plan is to clean and prepare the data, choose features that capture customer and product behavior, and then apply K-Means clustering to see how the groups form. From there we will evaluate the clusters and describe them in clear terms, showing how the results can guide decisions for marketing, promotions, and inventory.\nThe introduction should:\n\nDevelop a storyline that captures attention and maintains interest.\nYour audience is your peers\nClearly state the problem or question you’re addressing.\n\n\n\nIntroduce why it is relevant needs.\nProvide an overview of your approach.\n\nExample of writing including citing references:\nThis is an introduction to ….. regression, which is a non-parametric estimator that estimates the conditional expectation of two variables which is random. The goal of a kernel regression is to discover the non-linear relationship between two random variables. To discover the non-linear relationship, kernel estimator or kernel smoothing is the main method to estimate the curve for non-parametric statistics. In kernel estimator, weight function is known as kernel function (efr2008?). Cite this paper (bro2014principal?). The GEE (wang2014?). The PCA (daffertshofer2004pca?). Topology can be used in machine learning (adams2021topology?)\nFor Symbolic Regression (wang2019symbolic?) This is my work and I want to add more work…\nCite new paper (su2012linear?)"

It matters because smaller stores still need simple ways to understand buying patterns and target customers better. The authors cleaned the data, tested cluster counts with the elbow method, and profiled the groups by behavior. The results gave clear segments that stores can use for marketing and stocking, though the setup is limited by the data available to small shops."

It’s important because simple, interpretable clusters help teams design targeted offers and loyalty programs. The authors picked the number of clusters using the elbow method and the Calinski–Harabasz index, then described each group in plain terms. It shows a straightforward pipeline from retail data to actionable profiles, but it does not bring in extra context like demographics."

The goal is cleaner groups that help with targeting and retention. Using a large UK online retail dataset, the authors built RFM, compared standard vs weighted K Means, and evaluated with silhouette scores. Weighted K Means did better (about 0.40 vs 0.30), but using only RFM can miss other behavior, so the view of the customer is still limited."

It matters because the choice of algorithm changes how useful the groups are for marketing and planning. The results showed GMM scored highest on silhouette (around 0.80) in this setup, with K Means and others lower. The dataset is mostly transactions, so the clusters do not include extra context like demographics or browsing."

    "text": "Methods\n\nDetail the models or algorithms used.\nJustify your choices based on the problem and data.\n\nThe common non-parametric regression model is \\(Y_i = m(X_i) + \\varepsilon_i\\), where \\(Y_i\\) can be defined as the sum of the regression function value \\(m(x)\\) for \\(X_i\\). Here \\(m(x)\\) is unknown and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) some errors. With the help of this definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e. \\(m(x)\\) can be estimated with the product of \\(Y_i\\) average and \\(X_i\\) is near to \\(x\\). In other words, this means that we are discovering the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data points. The estimation formula is printed below (R-base?):\n\\[\nM_n(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \\tag{1}\n\\]\\(W_n(x)\\) is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers. Weights are positive numbers and small if \\(X_i\\) is far from \\(x\\).\nAnother equation:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 +\\varepsilon_i\n\\]"
