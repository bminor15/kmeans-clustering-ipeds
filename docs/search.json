    "text": "Introduction\nIn retail, not all consumers are alike. Some people shop frequently and spend a lot of money, while others buy little or just sometimes. Treating all consumers equally might lead to lost opportunities. K-Means clustering assists merchants by grouping clients who exhibit similar habits, such as spending levels or purchasing frequency. These categories can then be targeted with relevant promotions, discounts, and services. Beyond consumers, K-Means may be utilized in inventory management to eliminate waste and enhance stock planning by categorizing things as fast-moving, stable, or slow-moving."
